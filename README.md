# HyperFilmFilters

An LSPosed/Vector module (libxposed API 101-102) that brings back the film filters from old Xiaomi Camera to the filter panel of the new Xiaomi Camera (v6), on HyperOS.

## What it does

Adds film filters that the camera's current filter list leaves out. In the standard UI:

| Filter | Shown in the panel as |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| R600 | R600 |
| P100F | P100F |
| F-50 | Reversal |
| KC64 | Orchid |

KP160 is already in the standard panel as "Monsoon", so the module leaves it alone there; the Leica UI list does not have it, so the module adds it. The LUTs for all five are already part of the camera app; the module only makes them appear in the list.

The standard panel shows F-50 as "Reversal" and KC64 as "Orchid", the camera's own display names. The Leica UI ("Looks" panel) lists all five filters (R600, P100F, F-50, KC64, KP160) by their film codes.

## Camera versions

The module does not check the camera's version number. It looks at the camera's filter code and works with any build whose code has the layout it knows (a "profile"). The camera is obfuscated, so class names change between builds; the module tries each known profile in turn and uses the first that fits.

| Profile | Camera build | From | Status |
| ------- | ------------ | ---- | ------ |
| 6.7 | 6.7.000280.0 | HyperOS 4 (Xiaomi 17 Ultra) | Tested: standard UI and Leica UI. |

Other builds, such as one from another HyperOS release, may work if their filter code is unchanged, but only the profiles above are tested. The film code exists in older builds too (5.3 from HyperOS 2, 6.3 from HyperOS 3), and the filter LUTs are byte-identical across them, but those builds name their classes differently, so they need their own profile.

### When the camera's filter code is different

If the module can't find the code it expects, it leaves the camera unchanged (nothing is hooked, so the camera behaves as stock) and tells you:

- A toast appears in Camera a few seconds after it starts, once for each camera version, for example "HyperFilmFilters (camera 6.9.000100.0): The camera's filter code is different from the layouts this module knows, so no film filters were added."
- The same is written to the log (see Logs).

Smaller problems get their own message: the filter panel hook failing ("Some film filters may not show in the filter panel"), or, on a phone that uses the Leica UI, the Looks list hook failing ("The Leica Looks list is different on this camera version").

To get support for a new camera build, open an issue with the camera version and the `HyperFilmFilters` log lines.

## How it works

1. **Add the items.** The camera builds its photo filter list in one method. The module hooks it and appends the four missing items, using the camera's own names and thumbnails. Resource ids come from the camera's resource classes, or are looked up by name when a build has no such class.
2. **Skip the cloud merge.** The filter panel merges the local list with the cloud filter list and drops any local filter the cloud list does not name. The module makes the panel's merge check return `false`, so the panel uses the local list as it is.
3. **Leica UI.** The Leica UI builds its own "Looks" list from a separate table. The module appends the five filters there too.

| Target (profile 6.7) | Purpose |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| `Ii.i0.d()` | Photo filter list (standard UI): appends R600, P100F, F-50 and KC64. |
| `com.android.camera.fragment.m0.ut()` | Filter panel: returns `false` so the list is not merged with the cloud list. |
| `E9.h.c()` | Leica "Looks" list: appends R600, P100F, F-50, KC64 and KP160. |

## Use

1. Install the module and enable it in LSPosed or Vector. Set its scope to **Camera** only.
2. Force-stop Camera and open it again.
3. For the standard UI on a phone that uses the Leica UI, turn the Leica theme off. This resets on reboot:

   ```bash
   su -c "setprop camera.debug.theme_customize.disabled true"
   ```

   Set it back to `false` and force-stop Camera to return to the Leica UI.

If the camera misbehaves, disable the module and force-stop Camera to restore the stock behaviour. Nothing on the system partition is changed.

## Logs

The module logs to logcat under the tag `HyperFilmFilters`, not to the manager's module log:

```bash
su -c "logcat -d | grep HyperFilmFilters"
```

Useful lines:

- `camera layout 6.7, hooked ...`: a profile fit and the hooks are installed.
- `filter list: N items, added [...]`: the items were added.
- `does not match` or `cannot hook ...`: the camera's filter code differs from that profile.
- `the camera's filter code is not one this module knows`: no profile fit, so the camera was left unchanged.

## Build

A Gradle project. It needs the Android SDK (compileSdk 37, build-tools 37.0.0); put `sdk.dir=...` in `local.properties`, then:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The release build is signed with the debug key.

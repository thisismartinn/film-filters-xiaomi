# HyperCameraMod

An LSPosed/Vector module (libxposed API 101-102) that turns on three features the Xiaomi Camera on HyperOS 4 already contains but leaves off for the Xiaomi 17 Ultra. It is separate from HyperFilmFilters, which adds the film filters.

## What it does

| Feature | What changes in the camera |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| Palette and Parameters | The filter edit panel gets the Palette tab and the full Parameters list (tone, saturation, cold/warm, cyan/magenta, noise, soft light, texture, vignette), plus saving, sharing and importing filter presets. |
| Original colour style | "Original" appears next to Leica Authentic and Leica Vibrant in the photography style picker. In the Leica UI it gets its own "ORIG" badge, because the camera would otherwise draw it as the Authentic badge. |
| Leica Essential CMOS (M10R) | "CMOS" is added to the Leica Essential style list, between B&W (M3) and CCD (M9). |

Original colour style and CMOS only change the photo if the phone's camera hardware layer implements them. The camera sends the chosen style to the hardware layer; the module only makes the choice available.

## Camera versions

The module does not check the camera's version number. Each feature looks for what it needs and is skipped, with a log line, when it is not there.

| Feature | How it is found | Version dependence |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Palette and Parameters | The system property `camera.feature.styleVersion`, which the camera reads to decide whether to build the full Parameters list. | None. |
| Original colour style | The camera characteristic `xiaomi.capabilities.stylizationTypeMask`, bit 3. | None. |
| CMOS (M10R) | The Leica Essential list class, by a layout ("profile") that names it. | Tested: camera 6.7.000280.0 (HyperOS 4.0.5.0). 6.7.000070.0 already has the entry. |

When the Leica Essential list is not one the module knows, it leaves the camera unchanged and shows a toast in Camera, once per camera version.

## How it works

1. **Palette and Parameters.** The camera reads `camera.feature.styleVersion` through `android.os.SystemProperties` and builds the full Parameters list when it is 2 or more. The module returns 2 for that key when the real value is lower. The same effect without the module is `setprop camera.feature.styleVersion 2` as root, which resets on reboot.
2. **Original colour style.** The camera shows Original only when bit 3 of `xiaomi.capabilities.stylizationTypeMask` is set. The module sets the bit when the camera reads the characteristic.
3. **CMOS.** The camera's Leica Essential list is built in `s2.A`. In this build the CMOS entry is compiled out, along with three of its images. The module appends the entry right after the camera builds that list (not when it is read: the style picker keeps the list and counts its items once, so growing it later crashes the picker); the item class has no constructor in this build, so the instance is made without one, and answers the three image ids from its own assets. The new entry starts as a copy of the CCD (M9) entry, so the fields the Leica UI and the standard UI fill in are there, with the CMOS strings and images swapped in. The CMOS title string is also missing from this build, so the module supplies it ("Modern vintage", in the phone's language where the camera had a translation).
4. **Original badge.** The Leica UI picks a badge from a mapping that knows only two styles, so Original shares the Authentic badge. The module swaps the three image ids of the Original item for its own vector badge, and does the same for the badge the camera shows in the top bar for the chosen style, only when the camera picked an Authentic Leica UI drawable for Original.

## Use

1. Install the module and enable it in LSPosed or Vector. Set its scope to **Camera** only.
2. Force-stop Camera and open it again.

If the camera misbehaves, disable the module and force-stop Camera to restore the stock behaviour.

## Logs

The module logs to logcat under the tag `HyperCameraMod`:

```bash
su -c "logcat -d | grep HyperCameraMod"
```

## Build

A Gradle module in this repository. It needs the Android SDK (compileSdk 37, build-tools 37.0.0); put `sdk.dir=...` in `local.properties`, then:

```bash
./gradlew :cameramod:assembleRelease
```
